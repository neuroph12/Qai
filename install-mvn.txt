in order to prepare raspberries there is a row of things which need be done

check the mounte things with
df -h

this is the command to install the image on sd-card
sudo dd bs=4M if=2015-11-21-raspbian-jessie.img of=/dev/mmcblk0

copying the image back somewhere will work with dd again, this time the other way round
sudo bs=4M if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=custom-image.img

when the raspberry is working
connect to the thing with
ssh pi@192.168.1.etc

if the thing has already been online once, ssh will refuse assuming this was a hoax
so you have to remove the key using something like:
ssh-keygen -f "/home/rainbird/.ssh/known_hosts" -R 192.168.1.etc

on the raspberry first thing to do is to run the configuration and tell it to take the whole disk- first option really
sudo raspi-config

when that all is done (setup new password, etc)

alternative is the custom image with maven already installed on it under:
../custom-raspbian

you will have to mount the external-drive on raspberry as it doesn't do it automatically

to see where things are and so on:
sudo blkid

and then of course- mount with something like...
sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt

this is for the maven modules which should be installed:
maven install works like:
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=<path-to-file> -DgroupId=<group-id> \
    -DartifactId=<artifact-id> -Dversion=<version> -Dpackaging=<packaging

and these are the files which need to be installed in order to get the whole thing to work...
unfortunately, i don't know any other way how maven can be made to use jar-libraries... it is after all a very stupid convention to have
everything to come from maven-repository

mvn install:install-file -Dfile=./lib/bliki-core-3.0.19.jar -DgroupId=info.bliki -DartifactId=bliki-core -Dversion=3.0.19 -Dpackaging=jar
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=./lib/bliki-pdf-3.0.19.jar -DgroupId=info.bliki -DartifactId=bliki-pdf -Dversion=3.0.19 -Dpackaging=jar
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=./lib/grph-1.6.29-big.jar -DgroupId=grph -DartifactId=grph.all -Dversion=1.6.29 -Dpackaging=jar
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=./lib/samsroad-1.0.jar -DgroupId=qube.samsroad -DartifactId=samsroad -Dversion=1.0 -Dpackaging=jar

you'll need to install Qai in order to satisfy Qoan's dependency- do it with skip-test option!
mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true

when done with compiling and installing the whole- in order to run Qoan-server
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="qube.qoan.server.WebServer"

or Qai-node
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="qube.qai.main.QaiNode"

// these are for getting the latest copy of the whole
git pull rainbird@192.168.1.6:/home/rainbird/projects/work/qai
git pull rainbird@192.168.1.6:/home/rainbird/projects/work/qoan
